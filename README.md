# 👋 This is the Frame.IoT
The Frame.IoT is an Arduino-compatible board built for your Internet of Things projects and ships with the most popular components built-in — voted by the community. Now you can focus on building something awesome (instead of wiring up the basics).
# 💪 Everything you need
Powered by the ESP-32, the Frame.IoT is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled. We packed it with all the plug-and-play utilities you've come to expect — USB-to-Serial converter, automatic bootloader reset and Lithium Ion/Polymer battery charging circuit. To make it project-ready, we gave the Frame.IoT a microSD card socket for all your data logging/storage needs, a super powerful digital audio amp to stream audio over the internet and blast notifications, a 16-pixel addressable RGB LED ring to light up your project, a toggle that lets you choose to power your peripherals over USB or battery, and an unencumbered momentary push-button to trigger any action you choose.
# 🙅‍♂️ No waisted pins
Not all projects are created equal. If your prototype doesn't need some of the components built-in to the Frame.IoT — no worries! Each component is connected via jumper pins. Simply remove the corresponding jumpers and you'll free up the I/O for anything you want!
